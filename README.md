# TempTrend---Forecasting-Global-Warming-Impacts

## Abstract

Global temperature trends and their implications for climate change are investigated through comprehensive statistical analysis and machine learning approaches. Using historical temperature data from 1750 to the present, we analyze global, regional, and local temperature patterns across different countries, with a particular focus on Brazil, India, and the United States. It makes use of bootstrapping, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian analysis along with XGBoost and LightGBM-advanced machine learning models to forecast temperature. Temperature proves to be very different between regions; XGBoost tends to outperform others by R² = 0.93 when compared to LightGBM by R² = 0.91. From this, the tendency of a stable global upward trend was captured, especially during recent decades, and the effects it created differ among different parts of the Earth. This work provides valuable insights into the understanding of climate change patterns and supports the development of targeted mitigation strategies.
