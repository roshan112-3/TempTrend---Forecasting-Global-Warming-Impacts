# Abstract

Global temperature trends and their implications for climate change are investigated through comprehensive statistical analysis and machine learning approaches. Using historical temperature data from 1750 to the present, we analyze global, regional, and local temperature patterns across different countries, with a particular focus on Brazil, India, and the United States. It makes use of bootstrapping, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian analysis along with XGBoost and LightGBM-advanced machine learning models to forecast temperature. Temperature proves to be very different between regions; XGBoost tends to outperform others by R² = 0.93 when compared to LightGBM by R² = 0.91. From this, the tendency of a stable global upward trend was captured, especially during recent decades, and the effects it created differ among different parts of the Earth. This work provides valuable insights into the understanding of climate change patterns and supports the development of targeted mitigation strategies.

#### Research Question: How can we forecast global and regional temperatures for the coming decades?

# Introduction 

Global warming is one of the most significant challenges humanity faces today, with far-reaching implications for the environment, economies, and societies. The sustained increase in Earth's average temperature, driven by rising greenhouse gas concentrations, has triggered drastic changes in weather patterns, ecosystems, and resource availability. These shifts threaten biodiversity, disrupt human livelihoods, and create vulnerabilities in key economic sectors such as agriculture, infrastructure, and tourism. To address the wide-ranging impacts of global warming, it is essential to delve deeply into the historical and future trends of global temperatures, identify vulnerable regions, and propose strategies for mitigation and adaptation.

Examining global temperature trends over past centuries is fundamental to understanding the trajectory of climate change. By analyzing average, minimum, and maximum temperature changes over time, this study seeks to uncover patterns of accelerated warming in specific regions, identify seasonal variations, and detect anomalies that signal rapid climate shifts. Such insights are critical to determining the scale and scope of global warming and recognizing areas that are disproportionately affected.
